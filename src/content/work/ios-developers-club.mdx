# Title

During the fall 2023 semester, I served as the graphic designer for the iOS Developers Club at Chapman University.

> "Working with Brendan has been delightful, he's consistently delivered exceptional designs and is always keen to provide additional insights. His creative vision and attention to detail are evident in every piece he's produced, making a lasting impact on our club's identity."

Upon joining, my main focus was on building an extensible design system. I wanted to ensure consistency in colors and typefaces used in flyers, Instagram posts, and presentation slides. Part of this job involved redesigning the club's logo to fit an Apple-like aesthetic while retaining identity.

After redesigning the logo, I took an iterative approach to designing assets, starting with the First Meeting poster.

A QR code and call to action are strategically placed within all flyers, inviting immediate engagement.

For this particular flyer, I explored several different layouts including a previous Swift project created by the club's president. Because I had grown accustomed to the design system, I was more comfortable with exploring the possibilities.

For the second workshop flyer, I experimented with a more dynamic layout and a user interface design for a to-do list app.
