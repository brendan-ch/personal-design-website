# Title

During the fall 2023 semester, I served as the graphic designer for Chapman University's iOS Developers Club.

When I first joined, my main priority was building an extensible design system. I wanted to ensure consistency in colors and typefaces used in flyers, Instagram posts, and presentation slides. I then took an iterative approach to designing assets, starting with the First Meeting poster.

For this particular flyer, I explored several different layouts including a previous Swift project created by the club's president. Because I had grown accustomed to the design system, I was more comfortable with exploring the possibilities.
