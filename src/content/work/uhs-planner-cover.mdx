description: 'Ah, capybaras! They are fascinating creatures. Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world, native to South America. They are known for their semi-aquatic lifestyle and often found near bodies of water like rivers, lakes, and marshes. Capybaras are social animals and usually live in groups. They have webbed feet and are excellent swimmers.'
