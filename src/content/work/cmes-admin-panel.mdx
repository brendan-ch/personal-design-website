# Introduction

![CMES admin panel introduction slide.](/static/work/cmes-admin-panel/preview.png)

{/* The mission of the CMES project is to improve patient care in resource-constrained areas by providing medical practitioners with access to medical literature. Currently, we offer two solutions: a USB drive with content synchronization on-the-go, and CMES-Pi, a Raspberry Pi-based server that provides access to content via web and mobile apps.

As part of this project, I led a team in redesigning and re-implementing our admin panel. This is where CME content providers upload their content to the cloud for distribution to our platforms. */}
