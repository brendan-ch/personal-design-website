# Sketches

> "I started by sketching out ideas for the logo. I wanted to create something that would reflect the calming and peaceful nature of the Headspace app, while also being visually appealing and modern. After sketching out a few initial ideas, I moved on to creating digital mockups in Figma and Adobe Illustrator.”
