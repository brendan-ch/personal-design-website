This site may contain copyrighted material owned by a third party, which has not been specifically authorized by the content owner.

Notwithstanding a content owner's rights under the US Copyright Law, Section 107 of the Copyright Law allows for limited, or "fair" use of a copyrighted work without requiring permission from the content owner. As such, some copyrighted material on this site may be available as part of a transformative work, or presented as part of research for a work. In both cases, I believe that such uses fall under "fair use" as defined by the Copyright Law.

If you are the copyright owner of material presented on this website, and you disagree with my assessment of "fair use" with regards to your content, please [contact me](mailto:me@bchen.dev).
