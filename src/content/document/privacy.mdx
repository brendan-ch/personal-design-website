Welcome to the privacy policy for design.bchen.dev, referred to as the “Website” or “Service” in this notice. This policy describes how I collect, use, and share information about you and your use of the website. By using this website, you agree to the terms of this policy.

This policy was last updated on July 6th, 2023. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please email me at [me@bchen.dev](mailto:me@bchen.dev).

# Information I collect

I collect personal information including name, email address, and other contact information. This data is only collected if you directly provide it to me.

I process personal information in the following ways:

- **To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.** I may process your information to provide you with the requested service.
- **To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.** I may process your information to respond to your inquiries and solve any potential issues you might have with the requested service.
- **To request feedback.** I may process your information when necessary to request feedback and to contact you about your use of the Service.
- **To identify usage trends.** I may process information about how you use the Service to better understand how they are being used so I can improve them.

I also collect non-identifying information when you visit, use, or navigate the Service. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information. This information is needed to maintain the security and operation of the Service, and for internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Information I collect may include:

- IP address
- Device information
- Browser type and settings
- Information about your activity in the Service (such as date/time stamps, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions taken such as which features you use)
- Device event information (such as system activity, error reports, and hardware settings)

# Additional information

Some websites use “cookies”, which are small files stored on your device to personalize your experience and keep track of preferences. As of July 6th, 2023, the Website does not implement the use of cookies.

I may share non-identifying information with data analytics services, for the purposes described above.

Many web browsers, mobile operating systems and mobile apps have a Do-Not-Track option. There is no agreed-upon way to make this setting work across all websites and apps, so the Website does not respond to this signal at this time. If this changes in the future, I will inform you in an updated version of this privacy policy.

I may change this privacy notice occasionally. The new version will be shown by an updated "Revised" date and will be effective as soon as it is available. If I make significant changes, I may notify you by posting a notice of such changes. I recommend that you check this privacy notice often for updates.

If you have questions or comments about this notice, please email me at [me@bchen.dev](mailto:me@bchen.dev).
